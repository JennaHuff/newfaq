add user to user database



-separate favicons in a folder inside public
-root to individual questions, custom url (https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)

-figure out how to type useLoaderData
-might be good to replace Question buttons with react router navlinks
-ratebuttons is not connected to anything, it should either update a user's database or lift vote state in <Question />, in Faq.tsx

-merge faq table and forum table in DB
    add an column to specify which table the question belongs to
    display only questions belonging to the page (faq/forum questions)
    users cannot answer questions from FAQ
    

login must not be asked when user accesses the site, but only when the user tries to vote
it should then redirect to the faq

question__id: 21
vote: true
